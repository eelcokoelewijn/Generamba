## Usages
Every FlowMVP module needs the FlowController protocol and extensions to be available in the project. To install the FlowController protocol + extensions execute the following generamba command.  

```
generamba gen PATH FlowController
```

`PATH` could be a shared resource folder, like `Common` or `Shared`
